					Linux Path Traversal Application

I have implemented Linux path traversal application using Java. It has following commands to run.

	1. mkdir <dirName> <dirName> .... - create multiple directory with specified name.
 	2. ls - print all directory inside this directory.
 	3. cd <distDir>/<>/... - change direcotry.
 	4. pwd - print current working directory.
 	5. rm <dirName> <dirName> .... - remove given all directory.

For more details please check video tutorials.

Note :- Due to time constraints i have skiped relative path inputs.
