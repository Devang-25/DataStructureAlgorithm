# Data Structure and Algorithm Concept in Java
This is easy and efficient implementation of DataStructure and Algorithm concepts,
problems and examples in java.
I have covered all topic in data structure given as below.

  1. arithmetic 	  
  2. array 	
  3. binarysearchtree 	
	4. dictionary 	
	5. divideconquer 	
	6. doublylinkedlist 	
	7. dp 	
	8. graph 	
	9. hackerrank/algorithm 	
	10. heapsort 	
	11. linkedlist 	
	12. priorityqueue 	
	13. queue 	
	14. stack 	
	15. string 	
	16. tree 	
	17. treeoperation
  
  All above section contains important questions under that topic.
  It contains mainly programming interview questions.
